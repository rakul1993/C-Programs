#**C-Programs**

These C porgrams focus on the principles, theory and features of multi-user, multi-tasking operating systems. It covers processes, scheduling, input/output, memory management, file systems and system management. These concepts are illustrated by studying the operation of the UNIX operating system in detail. All Unix commands are basically C programs or shell scripts. Bellow I have listed a discription of each Unix based program:
